        <h3>My story</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is  Audrey Alexander and I run a small business where I make custom Jewelry.

Since I was a kid I have loved jewelry and how it made me feel. I remember playing dress-up with my mother and how excited I would get when I put on the final piece of jewelry, It made the outfit feel complete. My goal is to create pieces that make people have that same excitement I had as a little girl playing dress-up with her mom.
